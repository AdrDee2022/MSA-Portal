																																								<p>ADROIT complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and United Kingdom to the United States.

To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, ADROIT is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

																																								<p>If You have any complaints regarding our compliance with this Privacy Policy, You should first contact ADROIT at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information.” ADROIT will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

																																											<h4 class="card-title">Right To Access And Correct Personal Information</h4>
																																										</div>
																																										<div class="card-body">
																																										<p>ADROIT strives to make sure that our information is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. While Personal Information is maintained by ADROIT, You may access the Personal Information that ADROIT has collected directly from You to the extent required by law to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. Upon request made to the contact listed below under the section titled “Contact Information,” ADROIT will provide You with reasonable access to the Personal Information ADROIT has collected from You, or will forward your request to the health care provider that has contracted with ADROIT to provide you with Services. Because Personal information—for example, Your email address—is required to use the Site, we retain certain Personal Information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, transfer, update, modify, or delete this information by logging into Your account and updating Your Personal Information online or contacting ADROIT at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information.” In some situations, we may forward your request to correct, transfer, update, modify or delete your information to the health care provider that has contracted with ADROIT to provide you with Services. You may also limit the use and disclosure of Your Personal Information by either unsubscribing from marketing communications or contacting ADROIT at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information.” Please note that some information, excluding claims data information provided by CMS as part of the “Blue Button” program, may remain in ADROIT’s records even after You request deletion of Your Personal Information, to the extent permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles or required by applicable laws. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information ADROIT can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate others’ rights.</p>
																																									<p>Regardless of the above, however, and except as required by applicable law, ADROIT does not provide You with access to patient records and will recommend that You directly contact Your healthcare provider to obtain a copy of Your patient records.</p>
